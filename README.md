This project is a windows chat application.
<br/>
In this users between two different systems can communicate with each other,but they need to be connected to each other with wired medium.
<br/>
Users need to enter their port numbers,which need to match with their respective ports.
<br/>
If ports are matched,connection gets established.
And finally users can communicate with each other.
